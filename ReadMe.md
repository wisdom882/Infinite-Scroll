## 1. Getting started

### 1.1. Project Description

The infinite scroll is a functionality very popular in a lot of social
media applications and also other software applications, where we can
infinitely scroll through the feed.
This is a web design technique where, as the user scrolls down a page, 
more content automatically and continuously loads at the bottom, eliminating 
the user's need to click to the next page. The idea behind infinite scroll is 
that it allows people to enjoy a frictionless browsing experience.

## 2. How I implemented it

### 2.1. Technologies used

This project was just implemented with vanilla javascript, html and css:

- `Index.html`: This file contains the template on how the page will look
- `script.js`: I pulled photos from unsplash and iterated over them.
- `style.css`: Just for making the front end look creative.
